<p>Ben Cook has always been a small time criminal, But usually more of a loner. He did small time jobs, worked a variety of rackets, robbery, bookmaking, just about anything. When Sayuri's Gang moved in he was nervous at first, worried about getting muscled out of the game.</p>
<p>Then he saw what they were doing for the neighborhood, the way they protected their own, lifted it up, made it a good place. Someplace he and his Little sister could be safe.</p>
<p>His Sister (Sheryl) was MUCH younger, she's only 19 now, his mothers daughter, but from a different marriage, the family had none the less stuck together. and when mom Passed it fell to him to raise and take care of her, since she was about 9.</p>
<p>She meant the world to him, the only family he had left, and he wanted the best for her. Sayuri and her gang helped provide that, and he won't soon forget it</p>

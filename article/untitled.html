<p>Kya has a lot going for her, looks, Beauty, Athletics, but most importantly Brains. She started young, with a few friends from M.I.T. Figuring out how to break into Various banks and secure sites for fun, Always on paper though, never for real, the plans were meticulous, then "practiced" in real life, with timed sprints, Obstacle course,s Lock picking etc. but always doing their best to mimic the actual conditions of the target.</p>
<p>One day a local Gangster decided to put them to use, Coerced them into running one of their heists for real, through kidnapping &amp; blackmail. they had no choice.</p>
<p>It went bad. Real Bad, People died. Kya made it out, with the cash. She moved across the country and started a new life, now Jaded and darker than she was once before, she's happy to sell her talents as long as she gets first choice of the take.</p>

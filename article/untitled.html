<p>Bobarts father was a scholar, though and through, an expert in his field and Respected by his peers, he was one of the foremost authorities on the occult and ran one of the largest occult bookstores and libraries in the United States.</p>
<p>all that changed when he got too close to the truth, The Masquerade machine went to work on him, and when it was done, he was discredited and destitute. He took his own life in a fit of deep depression. He left behind a son who grew to be just like him</p>
<p>Bobart never knew what his father discovered, though as a child he unconsciously picked up on his fathers obsession, and it became his own. but rather than just knowing they exist, he idolizes them, and desperately wants to become one. he has no idea that the vampires themselves orchestrated his fathers downfall and subsequent death. He came to truth by his own due diligence.</p>
<p>When it comes to Occult knowledge he has surpassed his father in almost every capacity, partly due to his Perfect recall, He has studied dozens of languages, but never been able to travel outside Phoenix due to lack of funds. His father left him his library and store, although he Owns these outright, taxes, mortgage on the family home and other debts have crippled him financially.</p>
<p>Recently he has decided to be more proactive, after studying the Kindred from afar, he has decided to approach them, and attempt to curry favor by proving his usefulness, in the hopes that he can impress them and be gifted with their dark curse.</p>
<p>unfortunately althoguh the truth of their existence is well known to him, and even a good amount of detail, his "inner fanboy" sometiems peeks out. what he doesn't know for certain, he fills in the gaps, with Cartoonish, childlike Myth and mimicry of vampires from his childhood. With capes, and combed back hair. a cross between a perceived Ideal and misinformation</p>

<p>Toshi Was young, head strong, and kind of a brat. He didn't respect his parents because they didn't respect him. they were traditionalists, tried to force him to speak only Japanese and follow an Archaic lifestyle. They decided his school, his study, his hobbies for him. they were loving, in their own way, but stubborn and inflexible. Online he found a way to rebel safely, without upsetting his family, without being punished, without getting caught.</p>
<p>He was good, he started small, little things, but he got better, he learned in his spare time, between the activities his parents forced on him, the job they made him get. However as he delved deeper into the darker corners of the internet, the change in his personality did not go unnoticed. It wasn't long before things between him &amp; his parents became more heated. One day he stumbled on something he shouldn't have, some simple transactions, payments.</p>
<p>The work was meant to be secret, but it was sloppy. his parents were on the verge of kickingg out, he was fine with this, he wasn't interested in colelge anymore anyway, so he took a chance. He made contact. It was Tony he had found. Things were a little tense at first, But Toshi quickly demonstrated his intent to help, to prove that it wasn't a trap, that he wasn't a cop.</p>
<p>He and Tony met, casually at first, a simple one time payment, as thanks for helping. but they talked. Tony felt a sort of kinship for the boy, he empathized with his situation, and after a couple months, introduced him to Sayuri, to get a job.</p>
<p>Toshi took to the criminal enterprise like a fish to water, he soon had whole new revenue streams up 7 running for them, streamlining their bookmaking racket, and taking it online, for quicker payments and better security, becoming the go-to guy for all their Tech needs.</p>
<p>In a way he never outgrew his rebellious stage, and the fact that what he's doing is illegal is part of why he does it, it thrills him to break the law, to flaunt authority, he relishes in the Yakuza/gang image, sometimes trying to put on "tough-guy" airs to almost comical effect. The rest of the gang humors him because he has in fact become part of the family, and they respect his skills, even if those skills don’t involve a gun</p>

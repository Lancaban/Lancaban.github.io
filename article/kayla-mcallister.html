<p><img src="/_resources/3684693520c34f83805cbdade5e12257.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>About 24 years old</li>
<li>Has been a student of Liam’s for 3 years</li>
<li>Has served as Liam’s ghoul for 1.5 years</li>
<li>Has a crush on Liam</li>
<li>Her main duties at the dojo are managerial, since Liam trusts her - overseeing classes, handling problems, phone calls, leaving notes for Liam of things to tend to in the evening</li>
<li>She’s generally a very friendly, outgoing person. Can get closed off if something is bothering her. Can become the bitch she needs to if the situation calls for it or if she’s upset</li>
<li>Fear of snakes</li>
<li>Parents are alive and local; three younger siblings - one is in college, the one who died was the youngest (perhaps half a set of twins?)</li>
<li>Originally chose to study martial arts for self-defense - now genuinely enjoys it. Equally good with fists and weapons.</li>
<li>Enjoys spending time with friends, though she’s pulled away to some extent since becoming a ghoul - Liam still gives her time to be with them or family if she asks.</li>
<li>Hobbies include music, computers (both building and tinkering), some gaming, dance</li>
